Dina Millerman

I'm double majoring in chemistry and environmental studies and minoring in 
Hispanic studies. I'm interested in going into renewable energy, waste 
management, or new materials. I took this course because I'm interested 
in applying data analysis and coding skills to an environmental context.
I love reading, fitness, art, and the outdoors.
