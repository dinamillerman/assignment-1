1) mkdir answers
2) touch answers.txt
3) nano answers.txt
4) /c/Users/Dina/assignment-1/answers/answers.txt

6) You can use the command ls and then list the name of the directory after 
   it. So the command "ls data" would list the contents of data even if we 
   weren't in it. 
7) rm is dangerous because it permanently deletes the specified file or
   directory. If you accidentally used rm on a big folder of data files, you
   would permanently lose the data you had hoped to work with.
8) mkdir -p answers/results 
9) touch my_script.sh
10)chmod 775 my_script.sh
